Virtuaw-Graphnodes
==================

Virtuaw-Graphnodes provides pure and impure functional object oriented computation graphs for graphical node based programming interfaces written in Typescript. The adaptive architecture and metaprogramming patterns enable fast extensibility and seamless integration into existing libraries.

This library only contains the computational framework, the UI layer is kept abstract with default Web Component implementation in Virtuaw-Graphui - meaning custom UI implementations are easy to implement.
